While working on formalising properties of FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) variants,
I discovered that combinators from temporal logic could be used to simplify both the
statement of time dependent properties, and reasoning about such properties.  In this talk
I give a short tutorial introducing temporal logic and some of its more common combinators.
I then give some examples of how these combinators can be used in the context of FRP.
