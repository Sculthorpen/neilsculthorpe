Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is an approach to reactive programming
where systems are structured as networks of functions operating on signals. 
FRP is based on the synchronous data-flow paradigm and supports both
continuous-time and discrete-time signals (hybrid systems). What sets FRP
apart from most other languages for similar applications is its support for
systems with dynamic structure and for higher-order reactive constructs.

Statically guaranteeing correctness properties of programs is an attractive
proposition. This is true in particular for typical application domains for
reactive programming such as embedded systems. To that end, many existing
reactive languages have type systems or other static checks that guarantee
domain-specific properties, such as feedback loops always being well-formed. 
However, they are limited in their capabilities to support dynamism and
higher-order data-flow compared with FRP. Thus, the onus of ensuring such
properties of FRP programs has so far been on the programmer as established
static techniques do not suffice.

Here, we show how dependent types allow this concern to be addressed. 
By embedding an implementation of FRP in the the dependently-typed language
Agda, we can use the type system of the host language to craft a
domain-specific (dependent) type system for FRP. As the implementation
passes the Agda type, coverage, and termination checks, we know our type
system is safe.
