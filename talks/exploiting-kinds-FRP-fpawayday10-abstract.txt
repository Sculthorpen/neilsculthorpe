Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is an approach to reactive
programming where systems are structured as networks of functions
operating on signals (time-varying values).  This talk overviews
the key concepts of FRP, and discusses the advantages of
considering signal functions, rather than signals, as the primary
first-class abstraction, as well as the importance of
distinguishing between signals over different time domains.
