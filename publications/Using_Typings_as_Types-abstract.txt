In languages with dynamic scope, the free variables of an abstraction correspond
to implicit parameters. The values of these parameters are determined by the
bindings current where the abstraction is applied, but their allowed types can
be checked statically. We give a novel type system for dynamic scope using types
that involve type environments and intersections. We also explore how to give
typing rules with a high degree of modularity using typings themselves as types.
